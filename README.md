## Colour-restored Creative Cloud Icons

A set of icon files that can be used to replace the installed app icons for the late-2020 editions of the [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/) [Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud) suite of productivity applications on Windows and macOS. The shape of the graphics are the late-2020 style, but the colours have been restored to their classic, individually-branded app colours, so that they return to their easily identifiable state. The main benefits are twofold:

1. **Apps in the same Adobe-defined ‚Äúcategory‚Äù are now clearly distinguishable from one another** at a glance, reducing the chance of accidentally opening the wrong one, which can waste precious productivity time waiting for it to load just so it can be closed again‚Ä¶
2. In-line with the new Adobe CC logo, the icons when viewed together are now back to forming a large spectrum of colour, which is just **much more visually appealing**; makes sense for a suite of so-called ‚Äúcreative‚Äù apps!
