## Colour-restored Creative Cloud Icons

A set of icon files that can be used to replace the installed app icons for the new 2020 editions of the Adobe Creative Cloud suite of productivity applications on Windows and macOS. The shape of the graphics are the 2020 style, but the colours have been restored to their classic, individually-branded app colours, so that they return to their easily identifiable appearance. The main benefits are twofold:

1. **Apps in the same Adobe-defined ‚Äúcategory‚Äù are now clearly distinguishable from one another** at a glance, reducing the chance of accidentally opening the wrong one, which can waste precious productivity time waiting for it to load just so it can be closed again‚Ä¶
2. In-line with the new Adobe CC logo, the icons when viewed together are now back to forming a large spectrum of colour, which is just **much more visually appealing**; makes sense for a suite of so-called ‚Äúcreative‚Äù apps!
